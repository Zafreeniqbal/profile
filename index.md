### A Little about me

I am a trainee Software Developer for Leeds City Council and previously I was a Computer Science teacher at a High School. 

I have self taught myself the basics, such as html, css, a bit of javascript. I then started a degree with Open University and managed to acheive a 2.1 in Computing and IT.

Outside of the tech world, I am a mum of 2, a Friends lover and enjoy bowling and going to the arcade.
